Would someone tell me how this happened? We were the fucking vanguard of modding in this country. The R1Delta addon system was the addon system to use. Then the other guy came out with a single folder addon system with an mod.json. Were we scared? Hell, no. Because we hit back with a little thing called the Left 4 Dead 2 Addon system. That's three folders and an addoninfo.txt. For moisture. But you know what happened next? Shut up, I'm telling you what happened - the bastards went to two VPKs. Now we're standing around with our cocks in our hands, selling three folders and a Key Values file. Moisture or no, suddenly we're the chumps. Well, fuck it. We're going to one VPK.
